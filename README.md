> "My body is limited in what it can do so I’m not interested in what it can do. I’m interested in how I can raise the threshold of my attention and energy when I break it down to the cellular body. And it’s the whole body at once. All that cellular body is contained, like in a silhouette, of the human body. (...) And it's the multi-cellular body I attend to when I'm dancing."
